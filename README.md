# car-Prediction
Have download the dataset from kaggle, and as of now have used only the train.csv file.
Majourly have commented the codes regarding the encoding of the data as i have saved the processed data into a new csv file i.e clean.csv.
As it consumed more time and resource each time the code is being executed.
Will be continuing the project to improve it's accuracy as for now have got a bit low one.
